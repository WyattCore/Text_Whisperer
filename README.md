# Text_Whisperer

Text_Whisperer is a side project I wanted to create to dive into the world of Chrome Extensions. I decided to learn and implement this project in TypeScript, which I really enjoyed doing. The project is pretty short and simple: You select text and text whisperer opens a chat box that tells you more about it, along with extended chat functionality.
