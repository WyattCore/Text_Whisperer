# Text_Whisperer

Text_Whisperer is a side project I wanted to create to dive into the world of Chrome Extensions. I decided to learn TypeScript to implement this project, which I really enjoyed doing. The project is pretty short and simple: You select text on your web page and Text_Whisperer opens a chat box that tells you more about it, along with extended chat functionality.

## IMPORTANT

### If you try opening the extension in an environment that doesn't allow content script injection (pdf viewers), simply select the text and click on the "Text_Whisperer for PDF" button, then click the extension in the browser tabs area. This will send your text to the chat automatically.


### The backend is in a separate repository
